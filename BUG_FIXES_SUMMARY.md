# üêõ Bug Fixes Summary - IoT Anomaly Detection System

## Overview
This document summarizes all the bugs that were identified and fixed in the IoT Anomaly Detection System for GCP.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Requirements.txt Missing Key Dependencies
**Issue**: The requirements.txt file was missing critical dependencies for ML and visualization.

**Missing Dependencies**:
- `tensorflow>=2.12.0,<2.14.0` - For LSTM models
- `streamlit>=1.25.0` - For dashboard
- `matplotlib>=3.5.0` - For visualizations
- `seaborn>=0.11.0` - For statistical plots
- `plotly>=5.0.0` - For interactive charts

**Fix**: Updated both main `requirements.txt` and `streamlit-app/requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies and version constraints.

### 2. Streamlit App Schema Mismatch
**Issue**: The Streamlit dashboard was querying for `humidity`, `pressure`, and `power_consumption` columns that don't exist in the temperature/vibration-focused schema.

**Problems**:
- BigQuery query referenced wrong columns
- Missing error handling for empty datasets
- No proper visualization for temperature and vibration data
- Lack of interactive features

**Fix**: 
- Completely rewrote the Streamlit app with proper schema alignment
- Added comprehensive visualizations (time series, distributions, correlations)
- Implemented proper error handling and caching
- Added interactive filters and real-time refresh options
- Created device-wise analysis and anomaly highlighting

### 3. BigQuery SQL Schema Inconsistency
**Issue**: The BigQuery ML models SQL file referenced a non-existent table `sensor_data_temp_vibration`.

**Fix**: Updated the table reference to use the correct table name `sensor_data`.

### 4. Dataflow Pipeline Schema Mismatch
**Issue**: The Dataflow pipeline's BigQuery schema definition included outdated fields and didn't match the actual data structure.

**Problems**:
- Schema included `humidity`, `pressure`, `power_consumption` fields
- Missing new fields like `anomaly_reasons`, `temp_z_score`, `vibration_z_score`
- FormatForBigQuery function didn't match the schema

**Fix**:
- Updated BigQuery schema to include only temperature and vibration fields
- Added new fields for enhanced anomaly detection
- Rewrote FormatForBigQuery function to properly format data
- Added z-score calculation for statistical analysis

### 5. Docker Compose Missing Streamlit Service
**Issue**: Docker Compose configuration didn't include a service for the Streamlit dashboard.

**Fix**: Added a dedicated Streamlit service with proper port mapping (8501) and environment configuration.

### 6. LSTM Model Implementation Issues
**Issue**: While the LSTM autoencoder was implemented, there were potential issues with sequence preparation and prediction handling.

**Fix**: Verified and enhanced the LSTM implementation with proper:
- Sequence preparation for time series data
- Model architecture (encoder-decoder)
- Prediction and reconstruction error calculation
- Threshold-based anomaly detection

## üß™ Testing and Validation
